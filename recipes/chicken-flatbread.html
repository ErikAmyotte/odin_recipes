    <h1>Buffalo Chicken Flatbread</h1>

    <p>This spicy Buffalo chicken flatbread is perfect for a game day appetizer or a quick-and-easy weeknight meal. We often enjoy ours with a sprinkle of blue cheese or with celery sticks and blue cheese dip on the side. As an appetizer, this will serve 6 to 8, or 4 as a main course.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Buffalo sauce, such as Frank’s RedHot® Buffalo Wings Hot Sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 flatbread crusts (1 (14.1-ounce) package)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ranch dressing</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 slices crisp cooked bacon, crumbled (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sliced green onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine shredded chicken, Buffalo sauce, and garlic powder in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Place flatbreads on the prepared baking sheets. Evenly spread each with ranch dressing. Layer the flatbreads equally with mozzarella, sauced chicken, red onion, and bacon, in that order.</li>
        <li>Bake flatbreads in the preheated oven until sides are golden brown and cheese is melted, 13 to 18 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with green onion slices, and drizzle with more Buffalo sauce or ranch dressing, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
